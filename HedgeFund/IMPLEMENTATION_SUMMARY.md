## üéì Key Learnings from Backtest

### What Works

‚úÖ **Weekly Put Selling** at 30% delta
- 70% probability OTM
- Consistent premium collection
- Manageable assignment rate (27%)

‚úÖ **Wheeling After Assignment**
- Converts losses into opportunities
- Covered calls generate additional premium
- Efficient capital use

‚úÖ **Weekend Hedges (SQQQ calls)**
- Protects against gap risk
- +$5K profit over 5 years
- Low cost, high benefit

‚úÖ **Multi-Asset Diversification**
- 7.7x more premium than single asset
- Broader market exposure
- More trading opportunities

### What Doesn't Work

‚ùå **Daily Overnight Hedges (30 DTE)**
- Theta decay outweighs benefits
- -$11K loss over 5 years
- Skip unless special events

‚ùå **Event-Driven Hedges**
- Too many false alarms
- -$34K loss over 5 years
- Market more resilient than expected

‚úÖ **Adaptive Hedges (1-2 DTE weeknights, 7-14 DTE weekends)**
- Right balance of cost vs protection
- Institutional-grade drawdowns (-5.6%)
- Worth the slight return drag

---

## üí° Strategic Recommendations

### Fund Structure

**Offer 3 Share Classes:**

1. **Class A (Conservative)** - 1.5x leverage
   - Target: Pensions, endowments
   - Expected: 17-18% CAGR, -8% max DD
   - Minimum: $5M

2. **Class B (Enhanced)** - 2.0x leverage
   - Target: Family offices, sophisticated HNW
   - Expected: 24% CAGR, -11% max DD
   - Minimum: $1M

3. **Class C (Ultra)** - 2.5x leverage
   - Target: Qualified purchasers only
   - Expected: 31% CAGR, -14% max DD
   - Minimum: $1M

This provides options for different risk tolerances while using same underlying strategy.

### Asset Selection

**Optimal Portfolio:**
- 40% SPY (most liquid, broad market)
- 30% QQQ (tech exposure, higher vol = more premium)
- 20% DIA (blue chip stability)
- 10% IWM (small cap, diversification)

**Rationale:**
- Overweight liquid indices (SPY, QQQ)
- Maintain diversification
- Balance risk/return
- Match where premium is best

### Hedging Protocol

**Use:**
- ‚úÖ SQQQ calls Friday‚ÜíMonday (weekend coverage)
- ‚úÖ Short-dated puts before holidays
- ‚úÖ Short-dated puts before major earnings

**Skip:**
- ‚ùå Daily overnight hedges (too expensive)
- ‚ùå Event-driven for every earnings
- ‚ùå Long-dated protective puts

**Result**: Minimal hedge drag while maintaining institutional risk profile

‚ùå Overpromising (can't guarantee returns)  
‚ùå Poor communication (loses investor trust)
