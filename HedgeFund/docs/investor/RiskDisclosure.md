## Detailed Risk Factors

### 1. Options Trading Risks

#### Unlimited Loss Potential
- **Short Put Risk**: If we sell QQQ $400 puts and QQQ drops to $300, we must buy at $400 (potential $100/share loss)
- **Short Call Risk**: If we sell covered calls and underlying gaps up dramatically, opportunity cost of capping gains
- **Assignment Risk**: Must have capital to accept stock assignments (potential cash shortfall)
- **Pin Risk**: Options near-the-money at expiration create assignment uncertainty

#### Leverage Through Options
- Selling puts creates leveraged exposure to underlying
- 100 put contracts = $4M notional exposure on $100k capital (40x leverage)
- Margin requirements can increase rapidly in volatile markets
- Broker can force liquidation if margin requirements not met

#### Early Assignment
- American-style options can be assigned before expiration
- Ex-dividend dates increase assignment risk on calls
- Deep ITM options may be assigned unexpectedly
- Disrupts strategy timing and hedge ratios

### 2. Market Risks

#### Directional Risk
- Strategy has net long delta bias (selling puts)
- Extended bear markets reduce premium income and increase assignments
- Flash crashes can trigger multiple simultaneous assignments
- Gap moves (up or down) can exceed hedge protection

#### Volatility Risk
- Declining volatility reduces option premiums (income)
- Volatility spikes increase hedge costs
- IV crush after events reduces exit opportunities
- Volatility regimes can persist longer than expected

#### Correlation Risk
- SPY, QQQ, DIA, IWM are highly correlated (0.7-0.9)
- During market crashes, correlations approach 1.0
- Diversification benefits disappear precisely when needed most
- Systemic events affect all positions simultaneously

### 3. Liquidity Risks

#### Fund Liquidity
- Quarterly redemptions only
- 45-day notice requirement
- 25% quarterly gate on redemptions
- Manager can suspend redemptions during market stress

#### Position Liquidity
- Must hold options to expiration in illiquid markets
- Wide bid-ask spreads increase transaction costs
- Large positions may be difficult to exit quickly
- IWM options less liquid than SPY/QQQ

#### Market Disruptions
- Trading halts prevent position management
- Circuit breakers lock in losses
- After-hours gaps create unhedged exposure
- Force majeure events may freeze all trading

### 4. Technology & Operational Risks

#### Automated Trading Risks
- Software bugs could execute unintended trades
- API failures may prevent timely executions
- Data feed errors could cause mispricing
- Connectivity issues during critical moments

#### Human Error

- Reporting errors to investors

### 5. Leverage Risks

#### Amplified Losses
- 2x leverage doubles losses as well as gains
- -10% market move = -20% portfolio loss with 2x leverage
- Margin calls during stress force liquidations at worst prices
- Compounding losses accelerate with leverage

#### Margin Requirements
- Brokers can increase margin requirements without notice
- Volatile markets trigger higher margin needs
- Insufficient margin forces position closures
- Cash distributions to investors reduce margin buffer

### 6. Strategy-Specific Risks

#### Theta Decay
- Long hedges lose value daily due to time decay
- Cost can exceed benefit in stable markets
- Over-hedging destroys returns
- Under-hedging leaves exposure

#### Assignment Capacity
- Limited capital for multiple assignments
- Assignment clustering during crashes
- Must liquidate other positions to meet cash needs
- Opportunity cost of capital in assigned shares

#### Wheel Interruptions
- Assigned shares may not recover (value trap)
- Covered calls may not generate sufficient premium
- Stock could decline while holding shares
- Wheeling cycle can take months to complete

### 7. Regulatory & Legal Risks

#### SEC Regulation

- Increased reporting requirements
- Restrictions on leverage or derivatives
- Potential ban on certain strategies

- Execution delays during transfer

#### Options Clearing Corporation (OCC)
