## üìä Strategy Overview

### Investment Philosophy
Generate consistent income through systematic options selling while maintaining strict risk controls through adaptive hedging.

### Core Components

   - **Weeknights (Mon-Thu)**: 1-2 DTE protective puts
   - **Weekends (Fri)**: 7-14 DTE protective puts
   - **Coverage**: 100% of delta exposure
   - **Cost**: ~$5,460 over 5 years (highly efficient)
