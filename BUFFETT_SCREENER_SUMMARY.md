## 📈 Current Results

**Latest Screening (143 companies):**
- Companies screened: 141 (2 failed data fetch)
- Companies passing screen: 0
- Companies with MOS ≥30%: 0
- Average moat score: 0.0/10
- Average management score: 0.0/10

**Why No Companies Pass:**
- High valuations (P/E ratios > 30)
- Low growth rates (0% revenue growth)
- Missing financial data (current ratios = 0)
- High debt levels
- Current market conditions

## 🔧 Configuration

### Environment Variables
Create `.env` file with:
```
ALPHAVANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
FMP_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### API Keys
- **Alpha Vantage**: Free tier available, 5 calls/minute
- **FMP**: Free tier available, 250 calls/day
- **Yahoo Finance**: No API key required

## 📊 Data Quality

### Strengths
- Real-time data from multiple sources
- Comprehensive financial metrics
- DCF analysis with margin of safety
- Rate limiting and error handling

### Limitations
- Some financial data missing (current ratios, etc.)
- Growth rates calculated from limited historical data
- Conservative screening criteria may be too strict

## 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Add API Keys**: Configure Alpha Vantage and FMP for enhanced data
2. **Adjust Criteria**: Make screening criteria more realistic for current market
3. **Add More Metrics**: Include additional Buffett-style criteria
4. **Improve Data**: Better handling of missing financial data
5. **Add Alerts**: Email/SMS notifications for new opportunities
